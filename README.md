# AI-based Event Trust Engine

## Problem
Crowdsourced event platforms suffer from spam and fake events due to lack of verification.

## Solution
This project introduces an AI-based trust scoring system that analyzes event behavior
to identify trusted, suspicious, and high-risk events.

## Features
- Trust Score (0–100)
- Spam & fake event detection
- Color-coded risk visualization
- Live working demo

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Pandas
- Google AI (Gemini / AI Studio – design assistance)

## How to Run
```bash
pip install streamlit pandas
streamlit run app.py
